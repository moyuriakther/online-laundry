            <div>

            </div>
            <p>We are a group of super-enthusiastic people who wanted to make other people’s lives easier by providing 
                them with some extra time; the time they would spend sorting and doing their laundry. We believe there 
                is more to one’s life than spending time after doing laundry and so we provide you with the online laundry
                platform in Bangladesh. With our Website or Hotline number, you can choose which laundry service provider 
                you want to connect with and schedule a free pickup and delivery with us. It's an affordable and convenient
                way of getting your wash, laundry, and dry-clean done with premium quality. We do it fast, friendly and smart. 
                With that extra load off your shoulder, you can now sit back, relax and enjoy the free time; if we can add even 
                a little extra free time to your busy schedule, we would believe we are doing a good job.
            </p>
